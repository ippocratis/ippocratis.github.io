Control the amanos bulgar alarm panel modes and receive swnsor events with home assistant.

# Available info

Smanos as a company is a rebranding of Chinese chuango for the western market.

w100 alarm panel is a  WiFi panel and can fallback to landline call “notifications” 

It’s closed source and exposes no API 

The company stoped its notifications server in early 2025 and removed the w100 from playstore and Apple Store .

The android app can be easily side loaded as an apk

The iOS app is only available for you device if you had it installed before the removal .

We can achieve some major functionality of the apps like setting mode to home, arm , disarm and more importantly we can achieve notification delivery on alarm triggering  using a python socket listener and home assistant .

Thankfully the panel has the tcp port 6003 open and we can capture data from it and send commands to it .

```
sudo nmap -p- 192.168.1.18
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-08-27 20:51 EEST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.18

```


Due to a CVE we already know that we can send a payload to 6003 set up WiFi and set the panel mode to OFF .


https://github.com/lodi-g/CVE-2019-13361/blob/75712ea4d6308d2c2d5bc3693b27170da6869cc9/poc.py

The scripts already mentions the protocols  CGWPCS48 and CGWPCS53


I Decompiled the android app.
Uploaded the relative java class containg the payload info

https://pastebin.com/2J7aGxti


From there I listed all protocols mentioned in the Java class

```
CGWPCS48	Set WiFi
CGWPCS51	Parameter
CGWPCS52	RemoveAlarm
CGWPCS53	SetMode
CGWPCS54	QueryJion
CGWPCS56	NewVersion
CGWPCS58	SysnTime
CGWPCS49	ServerRegister
CGWPCS50	InsideLogin
CGWPCS55	ClearUser
CGWPCSUDP	UDP Data (broadcast protocol)
```

I didn’t manage to make use of any ather protocols other than set WiFi and set mode . 

I did try to remove accessories with RemoveAlarm with no luck .

#  The CVE script

Running the CVE script: 

```
python3 poc.py 192.168.1.18  wifi_ssid wifi_password
```

Return:

```
set_wifi: sending:      b'CGWPCS4805wifi_ssid320wifipassword20250824165905\r\n'
```

CGWPCS48 is set WiFi code

05 is action code? In this case setup?

20250824165905 is the timestamp 

24 aug 2025 16:59 and 05 sec

then it prints
```
set_wifi: receiving:    b'CGWPSC03030123456A*
*\r'
```


which is an Acknowledge message with the device id 1234567A

then it prints our device id and the disarm commands which we'll need in our following scripts

```
set_wifi: device_id:    b'1234567A**'

disarm: sending:        b'CGWPCS5300001234567A*
*0'
```
CGWPCS53  is the Set mode class

0000 is action code?

Disarm command **0
and last it prints 
```
disarm: receiving:      b'CGWPSC5300001234567A**1001\r'
```

again an Acknowledge **1001

# Creating arm disarm and home mode commands

So:
The command for disarm is

```
b'CGWPCS5300001234567A*
*0'
```

For arm
```
‘b'CGWPCS5300001234567A*
*1'’

```
And for home mode 

```
‘b'CGWPCS5300001234567A*
*2'’
```
What change is:

**0 disarm
**1 arm
**2 home

Mind the 1234567A which is your personal device id

So:

The scripts for home assistant will be something like:

Arm:

```
#!/bin/bash

ip="192.168.1.18"
ssid="wifi_ssid"
pswd="wifi_password"
port=60003
payload="CGWPCS530000DEVICE_ID**1"

# Function to send payload and exit after 10 second
send_payload() {
    { echo -n "$payload" | nc -w 10 "$ip" "$port"; } > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    sleep 1
    kill %1
}

# Main
send_payload
```

Create 3 identical scripts 
Only change the 

**0 disarm
**1 arm
**2 home

In

payload="CGWPCS530000DEVICE_ID**1"

# Setting up home assistant

Add your mode script to config/shell_scripts , create dir if missing

And add the paths to configuration.yaml

```
shell_command:
  w100_home: /config/shell_scripts/w100_home.sh
  w100_disarm: /config/shell_scripts/w100_disarm.sh
  w100_arm: /config/shell_scripts/w100_arm
```

Create the Dashboard:

# receive panel event notifications and deliver notifications to mobile devices

W100 panel as we already saw has port 6003 open and we send our payload to it to perform mode change actions to it.

- Listening panel broadcasts

We will use a simple tcp listener , a python socket library in our example to grab traffic from the port .

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket

def listen_notifications(s):
    while True:
        try:
            data = s.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            print(f"Notification received: {data}")
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error receiving:", e)
            break

def main():
    ip = "192.168.1.100"   # replace with your panel IP
    port = 60003           # default port

    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((ip, port))
        print("Connected, waiting for notifications...")
        listen_notifications(s)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Triggering a sensor will the panel mode armed or home will print 

```
Notification received: b'CGWPSC01010112345A6**020202202508231910510\r'
```

CGWPSC01 Protocol header (type of message, probably “event/notification”).

010101 event type (sensor triggered)

12345A6 device ID (matches what I extracted in my Wi-Fi setup step).

020202 sensor number ( when you add sensors to the panel they get an increasing number

20250823191051 timestamp:
2025 → year
08 → month
23 → day
19:10:51 → time (h/m/s)

0\r → End of packet marker.

Or maybe 510 is the current sensor event counter 0-999 and the end packet marker is just \r


Other message types 

- Heartbeat 

A 2-5 minute interval CGWPSC03030DEVICE_ID** code is broadcasted from the panel
 We'll use this interval as a failsafe keepalive mechanism for the listener script
 
- Arm , disarm , home modes acknowledge

The panel sends a succes/acknowledge message every time mode change

```
b'CGWPSC5300003000125A**
1001\r'
```


- Finalising the listener script

We need a tcp listener that runs 27/4 with low memory and processor load .

We also need to filter out sensors by their increasing number . 
That’s panel specific you have to remember the sequence you added your sensor to the panel . 
So in my case it’s 

```
01	Beam sensor triggered
02	Contact sensor triggered
03	Leaving room PIR triggered
04	Curtain PIR balcony triggered
06	Curtain PIR bedroom triggered
```

And finally we need to filter out heartbeat and mode change acknowledge messages 

In addition to that I’ll post 2 notification methods 

One simple using ntfy public server 
And one using home assistant companion app notifications

- NTFY

Extending the listener script to send ntfy notifications is simple 

Ntfy uses topics to deliver notifications the topic inane in the script have to Mach the topic you subscribe in your mobile app (ios&android)

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket
import requests

def send_ntfy(message, topic="myalarm"):
    url = f"https://ntfy.sh/{topic}"
    try:
        r = requests.post(url, data=message.encode("utf-8"))
        print(f"Sent notification: {message} (status {r.status_code})")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error sending ntfy notification:", e)

def parse_notification(data):
    msg = data.decode(errors="ignore").strip()
    if msg.startswith("CGWPSC01"):
        device_id = msg[12:20]
        event_code = msg[22:28]   # e.g. 020202
        timestamp = msg[28:42]    # YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

        events = {
            "020202": "Magnetic contact triggered",
            "010101": "Beam sensor triggered",
            "030303": "living room sensor triggered",
            # Add more as you learn the codes
        }

        return f"{events.get(event_code, f'Unknown event ({event_code})')} at {timestamp}", msg
    return "Unparsed event", msg

def listen_notifications(s):
    while True:
        try:
            data = s.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            parsed, raw = parse_notification(data)
            print(f"Notification received: {raw}")
            print(f"Parsed: {parsed}")
            send_ntfy(parsed)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error receiving:", e)
            break

def main():
    ip = "192.168.1.100"   # <-- replace with your panel IP
    port = 60003           # <-- default port

    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((ip, port))
        print("Connected, waiting for notifications...")
        listen_notifications(s)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Edit the 

```
events = {
            "020202": "Magnetic contact triggered",
            "010101": "Beam sensor triggered",
            "030303": "living room sensor triggered",
            # Add more as you learn the codes
        }
```

 Block so it matches your sensor numbers and description

Also edit the topic name to your desire under 

```
def send_ntfy(message, topic="myalarm"):
    url = f"https://ntfy.sh/{topic}"
```

 Ntfy is easily selfhostable so you could use your own instance 


- home assistant notification

Home assistant delivers notifications to http://192.168.1.24:8123/api/services/notify.mobile_app_my-user endpoint 

In order to deliver notifications to multiple devices  we have to create a notification group in config/configuration.yaml

```
notify: 
  - platform: group 
    name: family 
    services:
      - service: mobile_app_one
      - service: mobile_app_two
```

And use the http://192.168.1.24:8123/api/services/notify/family endpoint

app_one and app_two are the companion app device names for each device as shown under devices and services

We’ll also need a home assistant long-lived access token .
You can create one from user>security 

And finally the extended script to cover multiple home assistant notification and per sensor discrimination and heartbeat / panel modes filtering 

- Failsafe

Rely on the socket.timeout: The socket.settimeout() will be the primary mechanism for detecting a lack of communication. We'll set it to be slightly longer than the panel's heartbeat interval (e.g., 11 minutes).

Use the systemd watchdog as the ultimate failsafe: WatchdogSec will be set to an even higher value (e.g., 15 minutes). It will only be triggered if the entire script freezes and stops processing the socket.timeout exception, or if the system itself is too busy to run the script.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket
import requests
import time
import os

# Install this with `pip3 install sdnotify`
try:
    from sdnotify import SystemdNotifier

In order to highlight the dejected button so that currently selected e is displayed we need a custom button card. For that we need hacs install. for how to install and enable hacs read https://ippocratis.github.io/assistant/ 
Downside is only mode changes using the scripts will be mirrored means that mode change from the panel itself or the remote control or the official apps are not.
Reason is I don't have an obvious way to capture mode changes.
Panel indeed broadcast acknowledge messages but they are identical.

# Automation

- With home assistant mobile voice assistant using the scripts as actions .

Note that HA voice assistants need Local TTS and STT engines on the HASS server.

Read my quick how to selfhost them with docker here:

Example HA conversation automation:

```
alias: W100 arm
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: conversation
    command:
      - alarm on
      - Turn on alarm
      - Turn-on alarm
      - Turnon alarm
      - Turn on the alarm
condition: []
action:
  - service: shell_command.w100_arm
    data: {}
mode: single
```

- With iOS shortcuts

To make modes available to the iOS home assistant shortcuts and control central I had to add

```
# W100 scripts
arm_alarm:
  alias: "W100 Arm"
  sequence:
    - service: shell_command.w100_arm

disarm_alarm:
  alias: "W100 Disarm"
  sequence:
    - service: shell_command.w100_disarm

home_alarm:
  alias: "W100 Home"
  sequence:
    - service: shell_command.w100_home
```

To config/scripts.yaml

# Afterthoughts

You need a static Lan ip for the panel . thats easy from wothin router settings and the how to is router soecific.

# Summary

- Use the arm , disarm , home mode change commands in bash scripts and lunch these scripts with buttons in home assistant panel

- Use the python socket library to listen to the panels open port for messages . Filter out those message for sensor triggers , heartbeat and aknowledge messages.

- Make the scriot perssistent woth systemd and check health using a keepalive timeout making use of the heartbeat intervals.

- Obviusly this panel is not secure means if your wifi is compromised your panel easily gets disarmed.

that said if you have soend aome money on sensors and already iwn the panel you can extend its life with home assistant.

- Have fun
